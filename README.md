This is a small wrapper around MySql C++ Connector that provides convenient PDO like methods.
The reason of creating this was a lack of flexibility in the original connector library.
People who are familiar with PHP PDO extension may found this wrapper easy to use because it has methods like: fetchOne, fetchAll, fetchRow, query, etc.

Dependencies:
1. MySql C++ Connector
2. Boost library
3. Compiler with support of C++11 standard
